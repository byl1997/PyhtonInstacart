# PyhtonInstacart
This Data Analysis project was conducted in Python for  the Career Foundry Data Analytics Program.
### Project Objective
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns.
